Welcome to the Troop Creator!

This is a tool to create an army list for the Warmachine and Hordes Tabletop Games made by Privateer Press.
This is a fan project and I do not own any rights on either Warmachine, Hordes, or Privateer Press.
I only wish to contribute to the great community of this game.

You can access the live version through http://pumpi.github.io/troop-creator

To-Do:
- some minor issues with TIER-lists.
- Move Uas to other units
- Some graphical changes
- a lot of testing ;-)

This tool is not yet completely finished, which is why I still consider it work-in-progress or BETA.
If you find any bugs or issues, please feel free to report them to me via the github issue reporter:

(You will need a github account; it's ment to protect the github community from spambots)

Please feel free to contribute!
